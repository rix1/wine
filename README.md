# Wine üçá

Inspired by a wine flavour wheel I came across (similar to
[this one](https://winefolly.com/tips/wine-aroma-wheel-100-flavors/)) and the
["How We Feel](https://howwefeel.org/) app, I wanted to create a tool to help me
identify tastes in wine.

### Built with

Deno Fresh and Tailwind, hosted on Deno Deploy.

If you're running locally, clone the repo and start the project:

```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
